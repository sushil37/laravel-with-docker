## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 2000 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

# Welcome to the Laravel Dockerized Project! ðŸš€

This repository contains a Dockerized Laravel project setup for your convenience. Follow these simple steps to get started:

## Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd repo-name
```

## Install Laravel
Use this one-liner to install Laravel and move all files/folders to the root folder:
```bash
curl -s https://laravel.build/example-app | bash
shopt -s dotglob
mv example-app/* .
```

## Follow the Steps

1. **Dockerfile**: Contains basic Docker configuration for the Laravel project setup with the PHP version you need.

2. **docker-compose/nginx**: Docker Compose configuration for the Nginx server.

3. **docker-compose/nginx/laravel.conf**: Nginx server configuration.

4. **docker-compose/mysql**: Docker Compose configuration for MySQL.

5. **docker-compose/mysql/init_db.sql**: Load basic default data if needed (remove or comment out if not).

## Update Docker Compose Configuration
Don't forget to update the `container_name` for each app, db, and nginx service in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Run Docker
Here's what each Docker command does:

```bash
# Build the Docker containers
docker-compose build app

# Start the Docker containers in detached mode
docker-compose up -d

# List running containers
docker-compose ps

# List files and folders in the app container
docker-compose exec app ls -l

# Remove the vendor directory and composer.lock file (if present)
docker-compose exec app rm -rf vendor composer.lock

# Install Composer dependencies
docker-compose exec app composer install

# Generate a Laravel application key
docker-compose exec app php artisan key:generate
```

## Deploy
Access your Laravel application at:
```plaintext
http://server_domain_or_IP:8000
```
